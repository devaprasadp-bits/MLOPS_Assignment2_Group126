I have a MLOps assignment that needs to be completed. Requirements and Student Instructions are captured in StudentInstructions.txt. Please help me build it to completion following these principles:

Implement completely - don't just suggest
Follow the template structure exactly
Professional academic presentation (no emojis, formal tone)
Logs and comments should have student tone and should not sound like instructions
Use only allowed libraries (I'll specify restrictions)
Remove development scaffolding for final submission
Verify all requirements are met
Provide clear submission instructions in a separate markdown file
I'll review and ask if anything should be removed or adjusted for submission. Build it as a ready-to-submit solution."


Help me achieve the objectives of the assignment and build it to completion" - this signals you want full implementation following template/requirements exactly, with professional presentation suitable for academic submission
